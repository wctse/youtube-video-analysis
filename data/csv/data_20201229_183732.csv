On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:

Mistakes:
At 1:06:20, when changing r to equal 0.69*i, I said ""this is what we might think of as (2i)^x"", but that is not correct.  It's what we'd think of as [Exp(ln(2)*i)]^x for whatever complex number Exp(ln(2)*i) is.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Many people I talk to struggle to come up with data science projects. To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. 

Technique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.

Technique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like. There are tons of repositories of free data online, kaggle, google datasets, etc.. You can just browse these and pursue a dataset that piques your interest.

Technique 3 - Get feedback from and analyze your communities. Most online forums are filled with problems. Use data science to help solve them!

domVw8isGOI,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,7214,111000,0.064990990990991,267,5,128,PT7M54S,"In this video I talk about all of the considerations that went into where I went to school for my masters. I go into how I chose between a masters in computer science and a masters in data science. I also zero in on which schools specifically I applied to, and how I came to my final decision. 

Masters vs certificate vs bootcamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FjwzKFPuM&t=113s&ab_channel=KenJee

I get an avalanche of questions about which masters degree you should do to become a data scientist. People ask me if they should do a masters in data science, statistics, computer science, and the list goes on and on. I also get asked which specific one people should choose. Honestly, I‚Äôve only done one technical masters degree myself, so I don‚Äôt think I can get really granular with the specific school choices. Maybe, just maybe if I get enough input from my peers we will make a collab video with our best advice on how to choose a masters degree, since we will have a couple different perspectives.

Every person has a unique situation, and there are some really good reasons and really bad reasons to do a degree. I don‚Äôt think a masters makes sense for most people. I talk about the benefits and drawbacks of choosing a masters vs a bootcamp vs a certificate in the video linked above. Since I can only speak from my experience, I figure it could help a lot of people if I walked through some of the considerations I made when pursuing my own masters degree. For the record I have masters in global commerce and one in computer science, but I think the commerce degree is out of the scope of this video, so I won‚Äôt really touch on it here.

I talk about what git is, why it's important, and I also go through the general workflow of a data science project using git. 

At the most basic level, git is a version control system. It also allows us to work on things simultaneously with our teammates without messing anything up. To be honest, it has revolutionized project management and process control. 

Git lets us track our changes and revert back to previous versions as well.

In this video I'm addressing 5 common criticisms of RPE:

1. It's not good for beginners (Athlean-X)
2. People are using it to ""hide behind science"" (Athlean-X)
3. It's for p_______  (Greg Doucette and Mark Rippetoe)
4. RPE isn't accurate (No one in specific)
5. It's overinformation (Greg Doucette and others)

After returning to Canada, I had to spend two weeks in mandatory quarantine because of COVID restrictions. In this video, I take you through a week of powerbuilding workouts on the full body week of my new program. I also take you through an arm workout (pump day) and show some new intensity techniques for biceps and triceps. I also discuss lifting belts, beltless training and how to modify certain exercises if training at home.

How can we get really jacked and strong at the same time? A lot of people seem to think you can‚Äôt, (or you shouldn‚Äôt) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don‚Äôt quite agree with this. 

It‚Äôs common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. 
Most personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn‚Äôt capture the full picture.

The bottom line is: unless you‚Äôre going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. 

In this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.

If it turns out that pushing it as hard as possible is actually better for muscle growth, then we should just suck it up and do that. But if it turns out that we'd be better off being more moderate with our intensity, so we can balance volume, recovery and other training, then that's what we should do! In this video I'm speaking with 5 different experts about this topic and, while there is some agreement on certain aspects, as you'll see, there is some differing of opinion when it comes to the details.

If you‚Äôve only been in the gym for a year or two, I‚Äôd recommend starting with my fundamentals program instead, which has you training full body 3 days a week instead of 5x/week. https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/fundamentals

More details on the high frequency program:

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:

- Reduced soreness = better performance
- Improved recovery capacity = more progress
- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus
- High quality volumes = better muscle growth

Also includes:

- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets
- Exercise substitutions
- Video links for every exercise
- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart
- ‚ÄúProgram Explained‚Äù section
- A full FAQ‚Äôs section
- 39 scientific references

A Disclaimer About EMG Research:

There are various reasons to be skeptical about EMG research. Just because an EMG study shows higher EMG amplitude does not necessarily guarantee that there is greater muscle activation  (although this is most likely assuming the procedure was carried out correctly). In videos, I typically use the phrase ""muscle activation"" as an approximation to shortcut this bit of nuance.

However, greater muscle activation still doesn't guarantee greater hypertrophy over time, as there are situations when muscles can hypertrophy in the absence of activation (such as when being stretched). Still, in my opinion, if all else is equal, there is good reason to think that *some activation* should lead to better muscle growth than *no activation* and that *more activation* should lead to more muscle growth than *less activation*. At this point, there is a big question mark in the literature as to just how much EMG evidence lends credence to long-term muscle hypertrophy. Based on some correlations in the data, I suspect that it is actually more useful than much of the online fitness community seems to think at this moment in time, but skepticism should still be exercised.

In this video, I am *not* using EMG evidence to say ""Exercise X is better than Exercise Y"" but rather to prove the conceptual point that all heads of the delts are active to an appreciable degree in the OHP. Since this finding also makes sense biomechanically (given the combination of shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction present in the OHP) I believe this is a fair corroborative application of this research.

If you‚Äôve only been in the gym for a year or two, I‚Äôd recommend starting with my fundamentals program instead, which has you training full body 3 days a week instead of 5x/week. https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/fundamentals

More details on the high frequency program:

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:

- Reduced soreness = better performance
- Improved recovery capacity = more progress
- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus
- High quality volumes = better muscle growth

Also includes:

- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets
- Exercise substitutions
- Video links for every exercise
- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart
- ‚ÄúProgram Explained‚Äù section
- A full FAQ‚Äôs section
- 39 scientific references

The Simpsons is one of the longest-running shows in the history of television, and with characters like Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick, they‚Äôve had no shortage of health-related episodes and scenes. Today I dove deep into some of the funniest and most curious medical moments in the history of the Simpsons, such as Homer‚Äôs body fat test, Bart visiting an HMO, and Mr. Burns somehow having every disease known to man. Watch to the end to see what The Simpsons got right, and what they got wrong.

Just because I work in a hospital doesn‚Äôt mean I truly understand the every day hustle of being a nurse though, so I brought on my friend Bianca Antisera, a traveling trauma nurse, to share her insight. There were a lot of puzzling choices in this pilot episode, from unethical blood donations, patient privacy violations, and the bizarre premise that everyone in a hospital is throwing shade all day long. Anything you think we missed?

At his heaviest, Casey weighed 845 pounds and almost never left his father‚Äôs house where he stayed in bed and played video games all day. Today, Casey is employed, living on his own, and weighs under 300 pounds. His journey is nothing short of incredible, due in part to a supportive family, a strong medical team, bariatric surgery, and a commitment to improving his quality of life. Go, Casey!

Growing up I wanted to be one of two things: a doctor or a detective. So, I finally sat down and took an official career aptitude test from the United States Government to see which professional path I was best suited for. It was not a surprise to see that my results turned up mostly medical options, such as Acupuncturist, Nurse, and even Family Medicine Doctor! I also took a Buzzfeed quiz and those results were‚Ä¶ less reliable. Take the tests yourself and let me know which career you landed on!

Jacob Parish: https://jacobparish.github.io/arctic-circle/

For the most accessible exposition of iterated shuffling that I am aware of have a look at the relevant chapter in the book ""Integer partitions"" by Andrews and Eriksson. They also have a nice set of exercises that walk you through proofs for the properties of iterated shuffling that I mention in this video. 

I used Dan Romik's old Mac program ""ASM Simulator"" to produce the movie of the random tilings of growing Aztec diamond boards https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/software/ Sadly this program does not work on modern Macs. 

The arctic heart at the end of the video is a ""chistmasized"" version of an image from the article ""What is a Dimer"" by Richard Kenyon and Andrei Okounkov https://www.ams.org/notices/200503/what-is.pdf Thank you for letting me use this image.

Around the same time that Kasteleyn published the paper I showed in the video, the physicists  Temperley and Fisher published similar results, Dimer problem in statistical mechanics-an exact result, Philosophical Magazine, 6:68, (1961) 1061-1063. The way Kasteleyn as well as Temperley and Fisher calculated the numbers of tilings of  boards with square tiles was a bit more complicated than the nice refinement that I show in the video which is due to Jerome K. Percus, One more technique for the dimer problem. J. Mathematical Phys., 10:1881‚Äì1888, 1969.

Some great articles and websites to check out:

A very accessible introduction to domino and other tilings by Federico Adila and Richard Stanley http://www.claymath.org/library/senior_scholars/stanley_ardila_tilings.pdf

An accessible article about tilings with rectangles by my colleague Norm Do at Monash Uni. In particular, it's got some more good stuff about the maths of fault lines in tilings that I only hinted at in the video: 
http://users.monash.edu/~normd/documents/Mathellaneous-07.pdf  

A nice article about Kasteleyn's method by James Propp. Includes a proof of the crazy formula  https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2615 

A fantastic survey article about enumeration of tilings by James Propp. This one's got everything imaginable domino and otherwise. Also the bibliography at the end is very comprehensive http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/eot.pdf

An introduction to the dimer model by Richard Kenyon
https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0310326

Alternating sign matrices and domino tilings by Noam Elkies, Greg Kuperberg, Michael Larsen, James Propp https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9201305

Random Domino Tilings and the Arctic Circle Theorem by William Jockusch, James Propp, and Peter Shor https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9801068

A website by Alexei Borodin full of amazing 3d representations of domino tilings. A must-see http://math.mit.edu/~borodin/aztec.html

James Propp's name pops up a couple of times throughout this video and in this description. He's one of the mathematicians who discovered all the beautiful arctic mathematics that I am talking about in this video and helped me get my facts straight. Check out his blog  http://mathenchant.org  and in particular in this post he talks a little bit about the discovery of the arctic circle phenomenon https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2016/1/16/how-to-be-wrong/

As usual the music in the video is from the free YouTube audio library: Night Snow by Asher Fulero and Fresh fallen snow by Chris Haugen.

Today's t-shirts I got ages ago. Don't think they still sell those exact same ones. Having said that just google ""HO cubed t-shirt"" and  ""i squared keep it real t-shirt"" ...  :)

Jokes:
1. Aztec diamond = Crytek logo; 2. no. tilings of Arctic diamond: 2^(-1/12). 3. ‚Ñùeal mathematical magic, 4. (HO)¬≥ : joke for mathematicians (HO)‚ÇÉ : joke for chemists
Bug: 
Here one of the tiles magically disappears (damn :( https://tinyurl.com/ya6mqmhh
Nice insight:
If all holes in a mutilated board can be tiled with dominoes the determinant will work. Why is that?

This is the paper by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubenstein about the 1 2 4 8 16 30 sequence: http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/ngon.pdf

The nicest introduction to integer partitions I know of is this book by George E. Andrews and Kimmo Eriksson - Integer Partitions (2004, Cambridge University Press) The generating function free visual proofs in the last two chapters of this vides were inspired by the chapter on the pentagonal number theorem in this book and the set of exercises following it.

Some very nice online write-ups featuring the usual generating function magic:

Check out the translation of one of Euler's papers (about the ""modified"" machine): 
https://tinyurl.com/y5wlmtgb

Euler's paper talks about the ""modified machine"" as does Tanton in the last part of his write-up. 

Another nice insight about the tweaked machine: a positive integer is called ‚Äúperfect‚Äù if all its factors sum except for the largest factor sum to the number (6, 28, 496, ...). This means that we can also use the tweaked machine as a perfect number detector :) 

Today's bug report: 
I got the formula for the number of regions slightly wrong in the video. It needs to be adjusted by +n. In their paper Poonen and Rubenstein count the number of regions that a regular n-gon is divided into by their diagonals. So this formula misses out on the n regions that have a circle segment as one of their boundaries.

The two pieces of music that I've used in this video are 'Tis the season and First time experience by Nate Blaze, both from the free YouTube audio library.

As I said in the video, today's t-shirt is brand new. I put it in the t-shirt shop. Also happy for you to print your own if that works out cheaper for you: https://imgur.com/a/ry6dwJy

30:15 Chapter 6: The best of the best: 17/12
36:34 Chapter 7: Outramanujing Ramanujan

This was supposed to be a short video but in the end turned out to be quite a tricky to sort out. Anyway, as it sometimes happens, I got carried away and now the video really covers a lot of ground : Pell equations, visualising continued fractions by dissecting rectangles into squares, the relationship between continued fractions and the Euclidean algorithm, the irrationality of root 2. Overall quite a few thing that you won't find anywhere else :)

The way I tell the anecdote in this video is based on the following account by Ramanujan's friend Prasanta Mahalanobis: Current Science, Vol. 9 (3), pp. 74-75.

""On another occasion, I went to his room to have lunch with him. The First World War had started some time ago. I had in my hand a copy of the monthly Strand Magazine which at that time used to publish a number of puzzles to be solved by the readers. Ramanujan was stir¬≠ring something in a pan over the fire for our lunch. I was sitting near the table, turning over the pages of the Strand Magazine. I got interested in a problem involving a rela¬≠tion between two numbers. I have forgotten the details but I remember the type of the problem. Two British offi¬≠cers had been billeted in Paris in two different houses in a long street; the two numbers of these houses were related in a special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was not at all difficult; I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error. In a joking way, I told Ramanujan, 'Now here is a problem for you'. He said, 'What problem, tell me', and went on stirring the pan. I read out the question from the Strand Magazine. He promptly answered 'Please take down the solution' and dictated a continued fraction. The first term was the solu¬≠tion which I had obtained. Each successive term repre¬≠sented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two numbers, as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I was amazed and I asked him how he got the solution in a flash. He said, 'Immediately I heard the problem it was clear that the solution should obviously be a continued fraction; I then thought, which continued fraction? And the answer came to my mind. It was just as simple as this.' ""

There is a complete digital archive of The Strand magazine. You can find the page with the puzzle here: https://tinyurl.com/y2lnb8xf (page 790) 

If you read the puzzle in the Strand you'll find that the problem is actually phrased somewhat differently to what Mahalanobis remembers and Mahalanobis also does not spell out the infinite fraction that Ramanujan came up with. And if you do the math(s) some of the other things he says also don't quite sound right. What I am presenting in this video is my best guess for what really happened.

In particular, the continued fraction that I am talking about in video is probably the most natural candidate for Ramanujan's infinite fraction, but others have argued that it could have been a different continued fraction (which I don't buy :) You can find these other infinite fractions here: 'Ramanujan's Continued Fraction for a Puzzle"" by Poo-Sung Park https://tinyurl.com/yyfdscgr and here 'On Ramanujan, continued fractions and an interesting street number' by John Butcher https://tinyurl.com/yy6nv2yg

Solution to the red cross puzzle from Dudeney's book ""Amusements in Mathematics"" p. 168  :) https://imgur.com/a/bBuLOZN

Another interesting way to systematically search for solutions to the Strand puzzle is this: The equation we want to solve is 2 x^2=y^2+y. You can rewrite this as x^2 = y(y+1)/2. The formula on the right is just the formula for 1+2+3+...+y. So just keep adding 1+2+3+... and at every step check whether the number you get is a square ... :)

Other short formulas: 1) Expanding (1+‚àö 2)^n gives a number a+b‚àö2. Then a/b is the nth partial fraction. 2)  Play with powers of the matrix {{2, 1}, {1, 0}}

The music in this video is by Chris Haugen, Fresh Fallen Snow (playing in the video) and Morning Mandolin (for the credits)

A couple of remarks:
1. Probably the simplest way to deduce the sin and tan parts of the rational trig ratio theorem is to realise that they follow from the cos part via the trigonometric identities: sin(x)=cos(90-x) and tan^2(x) = (1-cos(2x))/(1+cos(2x)). Note that the second identity implies that if tan(x) is rational, then cos(2x) is rational (if tan(x)=c/d, then tan^2(x)=c^2/d^2=C/D and cos(2x)=(D-C)/(D+C)). 

2. Bug report. 
a) Here I redefine cos(120‚ó¶) = 1. 
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1362
Remarkable :(
b) This transition to the good stuff I clearly did not think through properly.
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1018
It's possible to make this work for all regular n-gons. There is only one complication that occurs for n's that are of the form 2 * odd. For the corresponding regular n-gons, if you pick up the edges in the order that they appear around the n-gon and assemble them into a star, things close up into (n/2)-stars. For all other n, things work exactly as I showed in the video. Having said that you can also assemble the edges of one of the exceptions into stars. Have a look at this https://imgur.com/68A3fEe and you'll get the idea. Anyway lots more nice side puzzles to be explored here if you are interested  :)

Just to give you an idea of the work involved in producing a video like this, preparing the subtitles for this video took me almost 4 hours. Why do anything as crazy as this? Well, just like many other mathematicians I consider the law of quadratic reciprocity as one of the most beautiful and surprising facts about prime numbers. While other mathematicians were inspired to come up with ingenious proofs of this theorem, over 200 different proofs so far and counting, I thought I contribute to it's illustrious history by actually trying me very best of getting one of those crazily complicated proofs within reach of non-mathematicians, to make the unaccessible accessible :) Now let's see how many people are actually prepared to watch a (close to) one hour long math(s) video :)

The first teaching semester at the university where I teach is about to start and all my teaching and lots of other stuff will happen this semester. This means I won't have much time for any more crazily time-consuming projects like this.

In turn Moritz Firsching mentions that he learned this proof from G√ºnter Zieger and he links to a very nice survey of proofs of Fermat's theorem by Alexander Spivak that also contains the new proof (in Russian): –ö—Ä—ã–ª–∞—Ç—ã–µ –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç—ã (Winged squares), Lecture notes for the mathematical circle at Moscow State University, 15th lecture 2007: http://mmmf.msu.ru/lect/spivak/summa_sq.pdf
Here is a link to JSTOR where you can read Zagier's paper for free:
https://www.jstor.org/stable/2323918
Here are the Numberphile videos on Zagier's proof that I mention in my video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyJlRUBoVp0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGsIw8LHXM8

Finally here is a link to my summary of the different cases for the windmill pairing that need to be considered (don't read until you've given this a go yourself :)

Enjoy!

P.S.: Added a couple of hours after the video went live: 
One of the things that I find really rewarding about making these videos is all the great feedback here in the comments. Here are a few of the most noteworthy observations so far:
- Based on feedback by one of you it looks like it was the Russian math teacher and math olympiad coach Alexander Spivak discovered the windmill interpretation of Zagier's proof; see also the link in the description of this video.
- Challenge 1 at the very end should (of course :) be: an integer can be written as a difference of two squares if and only if it is odd or a multiple of 4.
-one of you actually ran some primality testing to make sure that that 100 digit number is really a prime. Based on those tests it's looking good that this is indeed the case :)
- one of you actually found this !!! 6513516734600035718300327211250928237178281758494417357560086828416863929270451437126021949850746381 = 16120430216983125661219096041413890639183535175875^2 + 79080013051462081144097259373611263341866969255266^2
- a nice insight about the windmill proof for Pythagoras's theorem is that you can shift the two tilings with respect to each other and you get different dissection proofs this way. Particularly nice ones result when you place the vertices of the large square at the centres of the smaller squares :)
- proving that there is only one straight square cross: observe that the five pieces of the cross can be lined up into a long rectangle with short side is x. Since the area of the rectangle is the prime p, x has to be 1. Very pretty :)
- Mathologer videos covering the ticked beautiful proofs in the math beauty pageant:
e^i pi=-1 : https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0 (there are actually a couple of videos in which I talk about this but this is the main one)
infinitely many primes: Mentioned a couple of times: This video has a really fun proof off the beaten track:https://youtu.be/LFwSIdLSosI
pi^2/6: Again mentioned a couple of times but this one here is the main video: https://youtu.be/yPl64xi_ZZA
root 2 is irrational: one of the videos in which I present a proof: https://youtu.be/f1yDExNAEMg
pi is transcendental: https://youtu.be/9gk_8mQuerg
And actually there is one more on the list, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem that is a corollary of of what I do in this video: https://youtu.be/7s-YM-kcKME
- When you start with the 11k windmill and then alternate swapping yz and the footprint construction, you'll start cycling through  different windmill solutions and will eventually reach one of the solutions we are really interested in. Zagier et al talk about this in an article in the American Mathematical Monthly ""New Looks at Old Number Theory"" https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.243?seq=1",2d,sd,true,2020-01-25T14:13:49Z,"['Fermat', 'Zagier', 'one-sentence proof', 'windmill proof']",27,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DjI1NICfjOk/hqdefault.jpg,dict_keys(['en-US']),['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge'],en-US
00w8gu2aL-w,Fermat's Christmas theorem: Visualising the hidden circle in pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+...,137613,667000,0.20631634182908545,5883,51,731,PT25M9S,"NEW (Christmas 2019). Two ways to support Mathologer

Leibniz's formula pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+... is one of the most iconic pi formulas. It is also one of the most surprising when you first encounter it. Why? Well, usually when we see pi we expect a circle close-by. And there is definitely no circle in sight anywhere here, just the odd numbers combining in a magical way into pi. However, if you look hard enough you can discover a huge circle at the core of this formula. 

Here is a link to the relevant chapter in Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's book Geometry and the Imagination (Google books). I am pretty sure that the idea and proof for the circle proof of the Leibniz formula that I mathologerise in this video first appeared in this book and is due to the authors: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=7WY5AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false

Here is a link to a video in which 3blue1brown about the same hidden circle in Leibniz formula:
https://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY
And another video by him about a hidden circle in the solution to the Basel problem: 
https://youtu.be/d-o3eB9sfls

There is also a neat generalisation to what we talked about in this video to the solution of the Basel problem - in terms of the lattice points in a 4-dimensional sphere and the 4-square counterpart of the 4(good-bad) theorem. If you are interested in some details have a look at the last proof in this write-up by Robin Chapman: https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/rjchapma/etc/zeta2.pdf 

Links to two Numberphile videos about the one-sentence proof by Don Zagier featuring Matthias Kreck: https://youtu.be/SyJlRUBoVp0 (intro), https://youtu.be/yGsIw8LHXM8 (the math)

I just found out that Gyrovectors are indeed associative.  I misunderstood the context of the claim in the paper, which was referring to mobius addition, not the full gyrovector addition which corrects the associativity.  I apologize for the mistake!

=== FAQ ===
Q: Does this use your Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine?
A: No, I'm using Unity for this and it's a totally different effect (no portals)

Q: What systems will this be released for?
A: For sure PC/Linux/Mac on Steam, maybe a console if it becomes popular enough.

Q: Will there be a VR version?
A: Eventually, yes.  But it will likely come as an update.

Q: Is the game free and/or open source?
A: The game is paid, but the engine will be open source so you can make your own Non-Euclidean games.

Euler's polyhedron formula is one of the simplest and beautiful theorems in topology. In this video we first derive the formula for the area of a spherical polygon using two theorems proven in the previous two videos which are linked above. This result is then used to prove the fact that V-E+F = 2 is true for all convex polyhedra by projecting the polyhedron on the surface of the sphere and doing some algebraic manipulation.

Summary:

The Fermat point of a triangle ABC is a point P such that the sum of distances PA+PB+PC is a minimum.

To find the Fermat point of a triangle ABC:
1. Construct equilateral triangles on each side of ABC
2. Connect vertices A,B and C to the opposite and outermost vertex of equilateral triangle.
3. The point at which the three lines intersect is a Fermat point of triangle ABC.

In the case where one of the angles of triangle ABC is greater than 120 degrees the Fermat point will be located at the obtuse-angled vertex of ABC.

   2. Split it up into triangles (While it is trivial to triangulate any convex polygon it is has been proven that any polygon, convex or concave, can be decomposed into triangles and there are many triangulation techniques).
   3. Construct a rectangle of equal area for each triangle.
   4. Construct a square of equal area for each rectangle.

About the video:
Start with a unit circle and then inscribe a regular polygon inside of it. The area of a unit circle is Pi and so the area of the polygon can be calculate to find an approximation for the value of pi. As the number of sides of the polygon is increased the area of the polygon gets closer and closer to the area of the circle. If we can express the area of the polygon in terms of n (number of sides) then the limit as n approaches infinity will evaluate to PI.

Qs0V5ntEWWQ,Explainable AI in Python with LIME (Ft. Diogo Resende),951,40500,0.02348148148148148,63,1,22,PT17M2S,"In this video, Diogo Alves de Resende will be showing us how to use LIME to explain a machine learning model's prediction in Python. LIME or Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations makes it possible to understand black box classifiers which is an exciting field known as Explainable AI.

Local surrogate models are interpretable models that are used to explain individual predictions of black-box machine learning models. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) is a paper in which the authors propose a concrete implementation of local surrogate models. Surrogate models are trained to approximate the predictions of the underlying black-box model. Instead of training a global surrogate model, LIME focuses on training local surrogate models to explain individual predictions.

The idea is quite intuitive. First, forget about the training data and imagine you only have the black-box model where you can input data points and get the model's predictions. You can probe the box as often as you want. Your goal is to understand why the machine learning model made a specific prediction. LIME tests what happens to the predictions when you give variations of your data into the machine learning model. LIME generates a new dataset consisting of permuted samples and the corresponding predictions of the black-box model.

Diogo is the author of 4 machine learning courses on Udemy http://bit.ly/3nMTixd

In this video, I interview Worthan Kwan, a quant trader at a hedge fund to learn about his day to day, how much money people are really making, what the requirements are to become a quant trader, and much more! I also made a post a few weeks back crowdsourcing questions and I'm pretty proud to say that we got through almost all of them in this video :D

This is another data science SQL interview question and answer done from beginning to end in real interview style.

You may notice that I literally talk through every single thing that I'm doing. This is what interviewers are looking for. This way, the interviewer can clearly understand the approach you're taking and exactly what you're doing. It's crucial because if you do something wrong, the interviewer can actually step in and steer you in the right direction. It's also more conversational and way less awkward than you sitting in silence writing your query. 

This is how I practiced every single mock interview for my own FAANG data science interview. Check out the links below for the entire SQL interview question walkthrough series as well as the video about how I learned SQL from scratch in 11 days to pass my own FAANG data science interview. 

Hope you enjoy the video! ^^

It is the core of ‚Äòhypothesis testing‚Äô - an approach in statistics that lets you use data to evaluate your ideas. In fact, this theorem can be applied to a variety of real-life problems.

The Central Limit Theorem is a theorem in probability theory, whose first version was proposed by the French mathematician Abraham de Moivre in 1733. Moivre published an article where he used a normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the number of heads resulting from many tosses of a fair coin. The finding was nearly forgotten until the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace expanded it in his monumental work in the 19th century. Over the years, numerous versions of it have been discovered and proven by other mathematicians. Fascinating, right? Watch the video to learn more!

""Print"", for instance, takes a statement or an object and provides its printed representation in the output cell. It just makes a certain statement visible to the programmer. While ""return"" does not visualize the output. It specifies what a certain function is supposed to give back.

Once you know how to define a basic function in Python, it‚Äôs time to learn how to create a function with a parameter. If we look at the function we wrote in the previous lesson, there was no value to return ‚Äì it printed a certain statement. This time, we will create a function that will do a specific calculation for us, using parameters. Awesome, right? Watch the video to learn how!

I was sent away to boarding school when I was 15. I was a jerk. I had Neurological disorder that leads to involuntary movements and noises called ‚Äútics,"" but mostly I was just a jerk. At boarding school, if you messed up you received ""time"" which was either served by cleaning the school or sitting in detention. To this day, I hold the record of the most ‚Äútime‚Äù ever earned and thus ever served, in the entire history of the boarding school.  In my case most punishments also involved writing apology notes to whoever I had wronged, be it the headmaster, a fellow student, or a wall. I spent the majority of my evenings and weekends working off time and writing letters of apology. A few years ago....I found the letters.

You can download my full set of macros that I put together using the simple methods described in both videos from here:
http://www.qedcat.com/misc/burkard_macros4.log
Having said that I'd like to encourage you all to find and program your own macros. After all, the more work you do in this respect by yourself the closer you will be to being able to say that you solved the 4d Rubik's cube ""on your own"". 
I've also included the macros used in Roice Nelson's published solution (http://superliminal.com/cube/solution/solution.htm ) at the end of my macro file. To understand what most of these algorithms do, you will have to study Roice's write-up. Having said that the algorithm labelled 2nd 4-color series is a very nice example of an elegant short algorithm that twists just one of the corners. Well, worth studying in slow motion. Similarly, the 3rd 3-color algorithm is used for twisting edges (without worrying that it also mucks up some corners).

Here again is the description for the video on the main Mathologer channel. 
The vast majority of people who tackle the Rubik's cube never succeed in solving it without looking up somebody else's solution. In this video the Mathologer reveals a simple insight that will enable all those of you who can solve the first layer to design your own full solution for the Rubik's cube, as well as for many other highly symmetric twisty puzzles. 
For more details about this really very fundamental idea behind many twisty puzzle solutions have a look at this article by the Mathologer from a couple of years ago http://www.qedcat.com/rubiks_cube/
Googling ""commutator, Rubik's cube"" will also produce links to a lot of very good articles on this topic.

Also‚Ä¶if you can handle tight spaces and don‚Äôt mind a shared bathroom, you can stay at CUBE Capsule Hotel‚Ä¶it‚Äôs actually a pretty cool experience.

The second part of Hunted picks up immediately after the first with Alex seeking answers and coming to terms with his new reality.

I apologize if some scenes seemed rushed and aren‚Äôt as good. While editing I spilled water on my laptop and lost some key footage that would‚Äôve made the film better. So majority of the film are secondary shots that I wasn‚Äôt planning on using. I‚Äôm still in the beginning stages of learning filmmaking and I‚Äôm working on getting better and learning more. I‚Äôd appreciate feedback, good or bad so I can continue to get better and know what to look for when creating future projects.

Behind The Scenes/Blooper footage will be coming out soon on this channel so stayed tuned in the coming weeks

Hunted is a three part story and part three requires a BIG cast so if you are interested in acting as a lurker or in another film of mine in the future then contact me: hundoinquiries@gmail.com or Dm @iamchundo

I received the Blackmagic Design Ursa Mini Pro 12K about a week ago! It was purchased and sent from ACS Cameras (https://www.acscamera.com/) and they were nothing but extremely helpful. So far the camera has been extremely impressive. I got to unbox, setup, and show off test footage from this amazing cinema camera in this video. I swapped  out the pl mount for an ef mount, I added the blackmagic design side handgrip, I added a top cheeseplate made by smallrig, I added a  quick release top handle by smallrig, I added a samsung t5 ssd drive caddie by smallrig, and I mounted my Audiotechnica shotgun microphone  to the cheeseplate. Overall it has been a perfect setup. I even just tested out the Ursa Mini Pro 12K at a wedding. As soon as that video is uploaded I'll be sure to attach it here as well!

A blistering shred god heading up the Grammy-nomninated metal band Dragonforce, Herman is so good he sometimes sounds like a video game with his extremely creative and acrobatic licks, which makes sense, because THROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAMES might be the most famous video game song in the world thanks to its Guitar Hero lore. Herman has also become a major figure in the online guitar community, with his Twitch streams amassing millions of views for their fun and unique segments and guests. This one is extremely fun, so prepare to have an absolute blast on this season finale of Guitar Villains.
