Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:

The Simpsons is one of the longest-running shows in the history of television, and with characters like Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick, they‚Äôve had no shortage of health-related episodes and scenes. Today I dove deep into some of the funniest and most curious medical moments in the history of the Simpsons, such as Homer‚Äôs body fat test, Bart visiting an HMO, and Mr. Burns somehow having every disease known to man. Watch to the end to see what The Simpsons got right, and what they got wrong.

For the most accessible exposition of iterated shuffling that I am aware of have a look at the relevant chapter in the book ""Integer partitions"" by Andrews and Eriksson. They also have a nice set of exercises that walk you through proofs for the properties of iterated shuffling that I mention in this video. 

I used Dan Romik's old Mac program ""ASM Simulator"" to produce the movie of the random tilings of growing Aztec diamond boards https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/software/ Sadly this program does not work on modern Macs. 

The arctic heart at the end of the video is a ""chistmasized"" version of an image from the article ""What is a Dimer"" by Richard Kenyon and Andrei Okounkov https://www.ams.org/notices/200503/what-is.pdf Thank you for letting me use this image.

Around the same time that Kasteleyn published the paper I showed in the video, the physicists  Temperley and Fisher published similar results, Dimer problem in statistical mechanics-an exact result, Philosophical Magazine, 6:68, (1961) 1061-1063. The way Kasteleyn as well as Temperley and Fisher calculated the numbers of tilings of  boards with square tiles was a bit more complicated than the nice refinement that I show in the video which is due to Jerome K. Percus, One more technique for the dimer problem. J. Mathematical Phys., 10:1881‚Äì1888, 1969.

Some great articles and websites to check out:

A very accessible introduction to domino and other tilings by Federico Adila and Richard Stanley http://www.claymath.org/library/senior_scholars/stanley_ardila_tilings.pdf

An accessible article about tilings with rectangles by my colleague Norm Do at Monash Uni. In particular, it's got some more good stuff about the maths of fault lines in tilings that I only hinted at in the video: 
http://users.monash.edu/~normd/documents/Mathellaneous-07.pdf  

A nice article about Kasteleyn's method by James Propp. Includes a proof of the crazy formula  https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2615

A website by Alexei Borodin full of amazing 3d representations of domino tilings. A must-see http://math.mit.edu/~borodin/aztec.html

James Propp's name pops up a couple of times throughout this video and in this description. He's one of the mathematicians who discovered all the beautiful arctic mathematics that I am talking about in this video and helped me get my facts straight. Check out his blog  http://mathenchant.org  and in particular in this post he talks a little bit about the discovery of the arctic circle phenomenon https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2016/1/16/how-to-be-wrong/

As usual the music in the video is from the free YouTube audio library: Night Snow by Asher Fulero and Fresh fallen snow by Chris Haugen.

Today's t-shirts I got ages ago. Don't think they still sell those exact same ones. Having said that just google ""HO cubed t-shirt"" and  ""i squared keep it real t-shirt"" ...  :)

Jokes:
1. Aztec diamond = Crytek logo; 2. no. tilings of Arctic diamond: 2^(-1/12). 3. ‚Ñùeal mathematical magic, 4. (HO)¬≥ : joke for mathematicians (HO)‚ÇÉ : joke for chemists
Bug: 
Here one of the tiles magically disappears (damn :( https://tinyurl.com/ya6mqmhh
Nice insight:
If all holes in a mutilated board can be tiled with dominoes the determinant will work. Why is that?

FEATURED IN THIS VIDEO:
How to Get into the City: 
- From Pisa Airport (Gallilei Gallileo Intl Airport): Take the Pisamover to Pisa Centrale Station, and buy a ticket to Florence (Santa Maria Novella Station)
- From Florence Airport (Peretola)
Cheapest option is the new Tram from T2 to Santa Maria Novella Station in Florence.
Or just hop in a cab)

How to Skip The Lines:
(VERY IMPORTANT TO AVOID SPENDING HOURS IN LINES!)
- The most user friendly website for reserving skip the line reserved ticket times (for the Uffizi Gallery and the Academia Gallery (Michelangelo's David) is:
https://www.florence-tickets.com/florence
(But you‚Äôll pay more of a fee‚Ä¶but it is user friendly)
- The official ticketing website for the Uffizi Gallery and The David is B-ticket:
http://www.b-ticket.com/b-ticket/uffizi/default_eng.aspx
(Less user-friendly, but a cheaper ticket price‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not that hard to figure it out)
- The official site for reserving a climb for the Duomo is here (this will also include entrance into all of the attractions of the Duomo):
https://grandemuseodelduomo.waf.it/en/cumulative-ticket-great-museum-of-the-cathedral-of-florence

- You can also call to book a time at the Uffizi and David by calling this number from a US phone:
011-39-055-294-883
- Or this number from an Italian phone:
055-294-883

You can also sometimes book through your hotel (if you‚Äôre staying at a hotel)
Or go with a small group tour like ArtVivia (more expensive, but highly recommended):

I received the Blackmagic Design Ursa Mini Pro 12K about a week ago! It was purchased and sent from ACS Cameras (https://www.acscamera.com/) and they were nothing but extremely helpful. So far the camera has been extremely impressive. I got to unbox, setup, and show off test footage from this amazing cinema camera in this video. I swapped  out the pl mount for an ef mount, I added the blackmagic design side handgrip, I added a top cheeseplate made by smallrig, I added a  quick release top handle by smallrig, I added a samsung t5 ssd drive caddie by smallrig, and I mounted my Audiotechnica shotgun microphone  to the cheeseplate. Overall it has been a perfect setup. I even just tested out the Ursa Mini Pro 12K at a wedding. As soon as that video is uploaded I'll be sure to attach it here as well!

I'm going to strap a GoPro to myself as i snowboard to record training data. Then, we're going to use the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect other snowboarders automatically. We'll look at the history of Object Detection and algorithms, then come to interesting conclusions about what makes the latest version of YOLO unique. Using the bounding boxes will help me improve my own ability to navigate and analyze different snowboarding techniques effectively. AI tech is amazing, but let's talk less about it and just build it for our own day to day uses. I'm going to ask you 3 questions about Object Detection, so i'm going to need you to start studying from my list of curated learning resources below. 3 Data Wizards will win $50 in BTC each this week, everyone on Earth is eligible, get hype!

Welcome to the official YouTube Channel of the Sushi Traveler!

In these upcoming episodes of the Sushi Traveler, sushi connoisseur Mike Takla travels around the world one sushi bar at a time. 

Takla grew up in Southern California where these sushi bars served as the fancy go-to restaurants, hosting family dinners, birthdays and celebrations. In this new series, he will take his respect and appreciation for this Japanese delicacy to explore new locales, seeking out the people, places, customs and cultures behind this eclectic cuisine across the globe.

While dining at these establishments in Southern California, Mike Takla most of all learned one thing: sit across a sushi chef with the right conversation, and as a result the whole experience will take a turn for the best. Sushi Traveler is Mike's search for the world's most interesting sushi, and the chefs who rise to the occasion.

==========

üí• Top 5 reasons why this course is different (and better) from any other React tutorial, bootcamp or course you will find:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The curriculum is very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics as well as advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects ‚öõ.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn React from the best. This course is taught by Yihua and Andrei, two Senior Developers who have actually worked on massive React projects for some of the top tech companies in the world.

Yihua has worked on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and likely used.

Andrei has worked on enterprise-level React applications for large tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. 300,000+ students from around the world have now taken his courses and many are now working at places like Google, Amazon and Tesla üî•.

By having both Andrei and Yihua teach, you get to see different perspectives and learn from two senior developers as if you are working on projects at a company together with them.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Go beyond the React basics.

You'll learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using Andrei and Yihua's experiences, you will learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let‚Äôs just say we don‚Äôt shy away from the advanced topics üí™.

4Ô∏è‚É£ This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don‚Äôt know what to do other than watch another tutorial... No!

This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.

5Ô∏è‚É£ You also won't be learning alone. By enrolling today, you‚Äôll also get to join our exclusive live online community classroom to learn alongside thousands of students, alumni, mentors, TAs and Instructors üëã

==========

üí• Who is this course for?

‚óæ Students who are interested in going beyond typical ""beginner"" tutorials
‚óæ Programmers who want to learn the most in-demand skill of a web developer
‚óæ Developers that want to be in the top 10% of React Developers
‚óæ Students who want to gain experience working on a scalable large application

About This Video:
I invented method of making pots from wood ash instead of clay. The ash is mixed with water and formed into shape, left to set for 3-7 days and will then be water resistant like normal clay pottery. Unlike conventional clay pottery, no firing is required, the pot will set by itself in the air due to the high lime content of the ash. First the wood must be burned at a high temperature, well ventilated fire. The white ash is then mixed with water, molded into a pot using conventional pottery techniques and will then set due to the calcium oxide in the wood ash turning into calcium carbonate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The pot can then optionally be polished with a smooth object such as a shell while it's semi dry to give it a shiny finish. The resultant pot was then put in water for 24 hours without dissolving. It then held water for another 24 hours though some of the water seeped out. It should make a good alternative to clay pottery if there are no sources of clay around. A brick was also made to test it's ability to form bricks. The ash brick also passed the water test after spending 24 hours in the creek without dissolving. 

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Dr. Ahmed discusses these findings in Michigan as a ""case study"" for how traditional differences in practice patterns for DOs and MDs in primary care are also borne out in surgical subspecialties. He also discusses how expansion of graduate medical education (GME) could help strategically redistribute specialists  of all medical education backgrounds into underserved areas.

¬øC√≥mo Podemos ESCUCHAR Im√°genes SIN SONIDO?
Agradecimientos especiales al Dr. Abe Davis por repasar su investigaci√≥n conmigo: http://abedavis.com

¬øC√≥mo es posible Capturar Sonido Solo con Im√°genes de Video a Alta Velocidad?
Este video se bas√≥ en la investigaci√≥n del Dr. Abe Davis y sus colegas. Descubr√≠ este trabajo hace a√±os y me fascin√≥ la forma en que fue capaz de capturar la informaci√≥n de las vibraciones en un video con s√≥lo im√°genes. Siempre imagin√© que los movimientos de los objetos ser√≠an visibles como cuando se graba un diapas√≥n en c√°mara lenta - as√≠ que recuperar el sonido de im√°genes de alta velocidad parec√≠a una tarea factible. Pero la realidad es mucho m√°s dif√≠cil.

Las vibraciones del sonido s√≥lo causan que los objetos se muevan alrededor de un micr√≥metro. Esto es mucho m√°s peque√±o que un p√≠xel, por lo que el algoritmo debe entender las caracter√≠sticas de la imagen. Un movimiento en una direcci√≥n deber√≠a causar que algunos p√≠xeles se aclaren ligeramente, mientras que otros se oscurezcan, y este comportamiento est√° correlacionado a lo largo de los bordes de la imagen. As√≠ que el ruido puede reducirse porque es aleatorio sobre la imagen y hay suficientes lugares de muestra con los que podemos conseguir que se cancele.

My name is Doug Neill and I'm passionate about helping others reach their full creative potential. I teach a skill called sketchnoting (also known as visual note-taking and graphic recording), which for me is a gateway to doing better work. Check out the resources below for more info.

Risk Disclosure
All streams and videos are for educational purposes only and the opinions expressed are those of the presenter only. All trades presented should be considered hypothetical and should not be expected to be replicated in a live trading account

Risk Disclosure: Futures, stocks, options and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones‚Äô financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results Hypothetical Performance Disclosure: Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

Of course, as many chopped scallions as you have, a bit of salt, you can try kimchi, sesame oil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes...and you can make a dipping sauce by mixing  those ingredients in soy sauce and fish sauce to taste. Cook in 1-2 TBSP or high heat oil, non stick pan, like a crepe, 2-3 minutes on each side, till golden. It's a savory pancake, so treat it so with condiments that feel appropriate.

******
The Law of Attraction has been around for quite a while now, with roots that stem back into the 1800s, along with the rise of New Age Spirituality. 

But with Rhonda Byrne‚Äôs film, ‚ÄúThe Secret‚Äù that was promoted extensively by Oprah Winfrey, the Law of Attraction has reached whole new heights of popularity. This in addition to the continuous popularity and sales of Napoleon Hill‚Äôs ‚ÄúThink and Grow Rich‚Äù, have created a large following of believers in the Law of Attraction and the idea that our thoughts and feelings are able to quite literally change the reality we are living in.  

Which begs the question‚Ä¶ does the law of attraction work? Can I truly manifest the life I want? 

In the first part of this two-part series I‚Äôll be taking a look into the actual philosophy behind the Law of Attraction, the supposed ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind this belief, and potential explanations for why it can sometimes seem like our thoughts and feelings are able to change our reality. 

In the second part of this two-part series, I‚Äôll be taking a look at the New Age Spirituality industry, the gurus, and where the money flows. Because make no mistake: this is no small business. Individuals like Rhonda Byrne, Esther Hicks, Napoleon Hill, have made millions from promoting this ideology. But how trustworthy are these people, and is there a darker truth behind these seemingly innocent, ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù individuals?

Het is zeker jouw schuld dat je bent gescheiden? Heb je niet te vroeg de handdoek in de ring gegooid?!‚Äô‚Äô Dit zijn een paar opmerkingen welke gescheiden meiden naar hun hoofd geslingerd krijgen, zo ook Saida van inspiration woman. Saida heeft twee scheidingen achter de rug, maar bleef vertrouwen houden in de liefde die ze uiteindelijk gevonden heeft in haar huidige man. 

Hoe komt het dat Saida‚Äôs eerste huwelijk stuk liep? En Saida‚Äôs tweede huwelijk? Waarom ligt er een stigma op getrouwde vrouwen? En hoe waren de reacties uit haar omgeving?

Heb jij ook een slecht huwelijk of een slechte relatie achter de rug? Wat waren jouw red flags en ben je er sterker uitgekomen? Deel met ons jouw ervaring in de comments!

Meer over Spot On. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 
‚ô• Het platform voor en door VROUWEN.‚ô•

Spot On, bestaande uit Rowan Blijd, Vanessa Ackah, Widya Soraya & Ciana Mayam biedt een PLATFORM aan vrouwen die op zoek zijn naar HERKENNING en ERKENNING, die klaar zijn om TABOES TE DOORBREKEN en deel willen uitmaken van onze community. 

Spot On geeft jonge meiden munitie tegen het eenzijdige vrouwbeeld, tegen stereotyperingen en voor meer diversiteit en respect. Dit doen we door middel van diepgaande interviews en persoonlijke, urgente verhalen over onder andere de vrijheid om een hoofddoek te dragen, feminisme, vrouwen werkzaam in een mannenwereld, toxic relationships, self love & bodypositivity worden op onze kanaal behandeld.  

Elke week doen wij dit samen met een bekende influencer of een eigen heldin. Niet alleen onze gasten geven zich bloot, maar ook onze presentatrices. 

Spot on EMPOWERT vrouwen en wil dit altijd blijven doen!

Hello Lovelies!

Hope you're remaining healthy & safe.

We often think of quantum mechanics as only affecting only the smallest scales of reality, with classical reality taking over at some intermediate level. But in his 1944 book, What is Life?, the quantum physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger suggested that ‚Äúincredibly small groups of atoms, much too small to display exact statistical laws, do play a dominating role in the very orderly and lawful events within a living organism.‚Äù Schrodinger was a visionary - and perhaps very specifically in this case.

It was time to take another pass on the hair cutting robot. The new robot is bigger, better, way more reliable and travel friendly. I tried to cut MatPats hair (live) then my brothers hair and then my own. For some reason I'm compelled to improve the pattern carving functionality even though I have zero desire to actually use it....

One final thing - if you know of any actual problems that could use a better solution please leave a comment. One of my goals is to make a portion of my projects attempts at solving legitimately useful problems and I would love to have a good list of them.

Here is how I forged it out of steel but it should be very easy to do with aluminium! Definitely a nice way to use your workshop. Make them for others! Help against #covid19 :) DIY solutions have always been the best. And wash your hands! :D 



As you can see I made a double hook in this key instead of just a normal one. This helps to reach tight spacers or handles. Also the thumb support is great when you are pushing. And definitely it is super easy to hold hanging in your pocket, so it's not a pain to grab it to open something! Very easy to use.


This is a great homemade gadget to avoid touching handles or knobs that might have been infected. Good for drawers, buttons and switches also! Anyway disinfect it regularly as frequently as you wash your hands to avoid cross-contamination!



Let me know if you would have done something differently!

After thinking about it a few days, I found the perfect solution. At least for me. I made a design that uses most of the space of my cabinet and I have access to every spool without moving or restacking the other spools. With my solution a can store up to 28, 1Kg Filament spools.

During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ‚Äúthe Martian‚Äù home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney‚Äôs safe return. Based on a best-selling novel, and helmed by master director Ridley Scott, THE MARTIAN features a star studded cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pe√±a, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Donald Glover.

In Theaters - October, 2015

Cast: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pe√±a, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Donald Glover, Mackenzie Davis, and Chiwetel Ejiofor

0:00:00 - Intro
0:02:25 - Cyberpunk 2077 Customizable Penis Options
0:15:35 - ""How do wind up with Memes?""
0:27:20 - Sumito on going full time as a creator
0:41:55 - Chapelle on Ending Chapelle Show
0:58:50 - Jani Lane Cherry Pie
1:28:23 - Twitch bans ""simp"", ""incel"", ""virgin"", DMCA

2:14:00 - Outro 

SumitoMedia is recognized globally as a master of the meme -- but he‚Äôs also got thoughts on exactly what gamers should be able to do with wiener customization in AAA titles. And just a few minutes in, it‚Äôs easy to understand how Sumit can pull off recording videos every week by relying on his broad knowledge of internet happenings instead of  writing detailed scripts. 

So, how does a guy who studied electrical engineering and computer science wind up analyzing memes? It‚Äôs actually a cleaner path than it seems, aside from a period of discovery in which he realized he wasn‚Äôt going to be the next Austin Evans.

All 3 of us had a long, grinding road to what we do now, and Sumit explains the point at which he was able to flip the switch into full-time mode. A disagreement about comedian Bert Kreischer leads to one of The Create Unknown‚Äôs most serious, divisive battles in 71 episodes: The Great Cherry Pie War of 2020. Warrant‚Äôs classic might just be the song that breaks up this podcast.

Then it‚Äôs Twitch time, as we discuss the implications of Twitch‚Äôs new policy changes on speech. Is it really a big deal that ‚Äúsimp‚Äù and ‚Äúincel‚Äù are now bannable words?

The Patron army jumps in to ask Sumit about Kid Cudi, the best and worst memes of 2020, the future of memes in 2021, and a surprisingly sensible fursona.

Thanks again to all the patrons who make every episode of this show possible, and thanks to everyone new who showed up to the live Discord recording!

Vertical farms are incredible. They could solve our food security needs in the future and could change the way we get our food forever. In this video I wanted to look into what makes vertical farming so good, and what problems vertical farms face. With the largest vertical farm in Europe opening up in Copenhagen, Denmark and bigger projects planned for Abu Dhabi it is exciting times!

Oh and now Gareth George joins Patreon too. Hello. You've made the description but don't get any friends i'm sorry. Group 66 is just you. Make it count :)

Special thanks to @mahilyard25 and @Kadurchandan on Twitter for helping me find a copy of the Essential oil document from 1908, located in the University of Michigan library. 

Now words from our sponsors. Remember this is your home for the best chemistry based demonitization on YouTube, where all chemistry is yellow chemistry(even though it supposed to be red or brown sometimes clear) and don't mind saying sh*t alot

I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

jwcmFZRsckw,World's First LED Levitron | How to make a magnetic levitating spinning top from scratch | DIY,651,21000,0.031,80.0,1.0,,640,"Hey, everyone! In this video, you get to see how I made the LED Levitron levitating spinning top, you get to hear my scientific explanation behind how it levitates and what keeps it levitating in place, and of course, you get to see the cool thing hovering!
I spent a few months working on this project on and off, getting the levitating spinning top itself to be perfectly balanced and reducing the weight was the hardest part of perfecting the LED levitron, so in the end, it turned out pretty stable and I finally succeeded with my creation, I'm really glad to be able to share this project with you guys!
If you are thinking of making an LED Levitron like mine, then please go watch my first Levitron video before making this version, good luck if you also make it!

Peril & Promise is a public media initiative from WNET telling human stories of climate change and its solutions. Learn more at: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/

If you‚Äôre in the United States and you turn on the TV, accidentally open twitter, or start to read a newspaper app, chances are you‚Äôll see a bunch of people talking about the upcoming federal election. 

But what you might not see much of - coverage of the local elections where you live.  Let alone, information about those policy makers‚Äô climate ideas. 

Which is frustrating because, I‚Äôm going to let you in on a little secret now: a lot of climate policy happens at the state and local level. 

Compared to the federal government, local and state lawmakers are typically more efficient - they get more done in less time. They‚Äôre often easier to get in contact with and just physically closer than your federal lawmakers working in DC.  Plus, local laws tend to have a lot more direct impact on your life and how your community responds to the climate crisis. For example, a lot of your local tax money probably goes to fund education. Your locally elected school board is in charge of how that funding is used, and they get to decide if your local school district buys electric busses, or adds a climate change section to the curriculum.

But why is that? Why is your local government so much better set up for implementing climate solutions than the federal government?

While the quiet and slow river is murmuring in the background, we are sparking some life into the fire mounted on our hand-made three-legged stove, so that we can give you the dish of the day, our Deep Fried Burger. You can make the burger the traditional way, no need to rest it directly on the coals, however, no matter how tempted you might be to simply dig in once the burger is ready and stacked, be prepared to go all the way and deep fry it until golden. Then you will experience an incredible mixture of crispiness and softness - the very first bite will release the juices trapped in the golden bread-crumb cage and the taste will overwhelm you. This dish is easy to make and impossible to forget, especially when served with home-made beer.

Give it a go üòä!

Throughout the 1950s, aircraft designers around the world began developing a unique aircraft configuration, called a tail-sitter. Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. 

In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Soci√©t√© nationale d'√©tudes et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.

The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft‚Äôs design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft‚Äôs distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. 

On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it‚Äôs 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.

A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960‚Äôs it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

ADDITIONAL REVIEW NOTES:
Context: I live in what some might consider a noisy area‚Ä¶ I live next to a fire station, some guy who plays saxophone at 2AM on weekends, a big intersection with angry philadelphia drivers, and train tracks which host both the SEPTA, and a big ass freight train which goes by at ~2AM. I am a heavy sleeper, but that is no match for the 90 decibels I measured from the freight train horn. The windows are thin and this building construction sucks. For reference, a construction site is normally 100 decibels
Some battery drain 

Sleep score average for days prior to test

Does it work without a phone connected? Local storage?
Can you load your own sound files?
How long is the battery? Will it be that long in a few years?
Wireless charging on the case?
Do ears get hot and sweaty
What about side sleepers?

Honey finds coupons with the click of a button. A big thank you to Honey for sponsoring today's video!

EDIT: as of 11/13/2020, it looks like instagram has actually put even more emphasis on the shop tab in their newest app update by placing it on the bottom bar of the app, just to the right of the ""reels"" tab! So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar!

Hello friends! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the Instagram shop tab! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - and when the shop tab was rolled out - peeking its lil head out from behind the explore page - I was instantly intrigued. So I spent an evening perusing the shop tab, finding 3 different common themes of what Instagram wanted me to buy, and then purchasing those things, and trying them out. It was a WILD ride, as Instagram recommended me everything from full-on historical costumes to trendy ""e-girl"" fashion. Which outfit was your favorite? What's on your shop tab?

Remote Reiki session to increase motivation.
Being in a sleep, awake, occupied or engaged in other activities while simultaneously receiving Reiki, will never impair from its effectiveness. 
Reiki always works for your highest good and most benevolent outcomes.

The infinite wisdom of Reiki flows only where it is desired, affecting matter at subtle levels. Your personal acceptance and openness to receiving this healing  energy will dictate the level of energy to receive.

You are encouraged to play this distance healing recording repeatedly as often  as you wish. This Reiki sessions can have cumulative effects, meaning, the healing  energy infused in these videos is amplified each time you play it.

Each of us has our unique response to the healing energy and our experience can indeed vary from session to session. It depends on how sensitive someone is to energy. Just relax and enjoy this healing energy flowing to you.

This is a ""real time"" Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session. 

In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy.
It is extremely beneficial to drink water after receiving Reiki as part of the healing process.

I think we can all remember a childhood memory where we attempted to channel the super powers of a fictional hero in real life. In 2012, a young man named Jalen attempted to go Super Saiyan inside his bedroom. He broadcasted his attempt to YouTube, and it would go absolutely viral. Some made fun of Jalen, others replicated his video, the end result: A YouTube site wide case of Super Saiyan Mania. Jalen became somewhat of a laughing stock around the time of his videos release, but what few considered was the possibility of him being a troll. Today we take a look back at Jalen's YouTube legacy, determine the true nature of his creative works, and find out what happened to him after going viral.

There's so much to say so I'll try to move it along.  This wood was given to me from a local retailer and was the perfect opportunity to try something new.  I have been inspired by Daniel Nguyen for YEARS and always wanted to try my hand at something like this.

Here's his site: www.nugeandwood.com

As part of this commitment, we are accountable for confronting the many ways in which the Canadian arts sector has reinforced systemic racism in its programming, staffing, and audience engagement.

As one of many steps to deliver on this commitment, we would like to invite you to a digital roundtable discussion with leaders from Telefilm Canada, the Indigenous Screen Office, the Canada Media Fund, CBC/Radio-Canada, Bell Media, the NFB, and the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television. Each will present how they are looking inward, and will discuss what they are doing to make sustainable change.

Lyrics:

Hey there, baby, we met out on the dance floor
You pressed your body up against me all night long
I know what‚Äôs on your mind
Our souls are entwined
In a passionate embrace
The look in your eyes
Says ‚ÄúTake me tonight‚Äù
Well I‚Äôve got just the place
A place where we can be alone
Unless my mom and dad are home

Welcome to my parents‚Äô house 
My mom left out some snackies
I bet your feeling horny now
So why don‚Äôt we get nasty

Hush now baby
You seem like a keeper
But your high heels are so loud
My dad is a light sleeper 
I‚Äôve got my very own room
And tons of free food
What‚Äôs your favorite juice?
We‚Äôve got mango and apple and guava and apple
So many fuckin‚Äô fruits
My mom buys pizza rolls for me
Can you believe this shit is free?

Welcome to my parents‚Äô house
A king must have his castle
That‚Äôs my grandma‚Äôs basset hound
He‚Äôs such a sassy rascal.
Aren‚Äôt you, Marvin?
::Woof::
Shhhh!

Parents‚Äô house
Parents‚Äô house

We‚Äôre gonna bring the funk tonight
I‚Äôm getting the top bunk tonight
Drop and thump that junk tonight
Like a 360 dunk tonight
Mom‚Äôs cake is chocolate chunk tonight
This party‚Äôs getting crunk tonight
We‚Äôre sparkin‚Äô up that skunk tonight
Cause I‚Äôm your disco hunk tonight

Welcome to my parents‚Äô house
Welcome to my parents‚Äô house

Let‚Äôs use our inside voices
::Woof::
SHHHHH!!!!
Sometimes my mom just hangs around
To make sure I make good choices
HIT IT!

It‚Äôs the 2020 Christmas Special - the Caddicarus Christmas Special, to be exact. This means only one thing - a stupidly long video to close off a stupidly long year. The bricks have been relentless. After spending way too much money - nearly ¬£900 - on the brand new PS5 right after the PS5 reveal and PS5 teaser trailer dropped, I felt like a video review needed to be made. Not just of the system, the PS5 specs or the PS5 hardware, but the PS5 launch titles that would get you set up over the holiday season. Why? Because this stuff is expensive, and with out of stock messages everywhere and consoles selling out to dirty scalpers on eBay, I wanted to let you all know what I thought of the PlayStation 5 before you got too stressed trying to buy one yourself. Today we‚Äôll be covering Bugsnax PS5 featuring Bugsnax gameplay with a Bugsnax review, a Demon‚Äôs Souls PS5 review about the Demon‚Äôs Souls remake with Demon‚Äôs Souls PS5 gameplay, a Sackboy A Big Adventure review with Sackboy A Big Adventure gameplay, a Spider Man Miles Morales review with Spider Man PS5 gameplay running at a consistent 60 fps - which goes for every single one of these games sometimes even at 4k resolution and not just full HD 1080p - an Astro‚Äôs Playroom review with Astro‚Äôs Playroom gameplay, a Godfall review with Godfall gameplay, an Overcooked PS5 review with Overcooked All You Can Eat gameplay, and an Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla review with Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla PS5 gameplay. I hope you enjoy my little send off to such an awful year, and I‚Äôll be back soon. Right now, I need fast food and sleep. Before you buy - here are my thoughts and first impressions of the PS5!

Watch our latest video and find out.  We give you the top 10 signs of gifted children.  If your child displays any of the signs on our list, it is very likely that you are raising a little Einstein.

In this video, we draw from a checklist provided by Mensa, the oldest high IQ society in the world.  Gifted Children - a checklist for parents:

https://www.mensa.org.uk/gifted-talented/gifted-children-checklist-parents

As mentioned in our video, you may also want to look at a list of developmental milestones, provided by MedlinePlus:

http://bit.ly/352KD0a

In our next video, we'll be showing you ways to help your child BECOME a genius, so be sure to hit the Subscribe button and tune in.

DISCLAIMER: The actors in our video are meant to represent the people we are talking about in the video.  They are not the people in question; they are actors.

Now for some excerpts from 10 Signs Of Child Genius!

(But watch the video to the end to learn all the signs!)

EXCERPT #1:

""*Mensa* is the oldest high IQ society in the world.  It was founded on October 1st, 1946, and *today* we look at their current checklist for *gifted children.*  If your child displays a number of these traits, it is *highly possible* that your son or daughter . . . is a *genius.*

But, *before we begin,* does it matter if your child is *not yet* a genius?  No, because at the end of this *video* we'll be giving you some exciting *news* about turning your loved one into *a little Einstein.*Also, if you find our video helpful, please do hit the Like button.  It helps us out.""

EXCERPT #2:

""Physicist, Nikola Tesla, was famously able to read and remember entire books, *word for word.*  But unusual memory for your child may come in different forms.  Remembering nursery rhymes or what happened in bedtime stories.  Remembering what was said to them or spoken around them.  Remembering, *with clarity,* things that have happened.

It's also important to *know* that some child geniuses remember *more easily* things that they've *read*.  Others remember better when it comes to things they've *heard.*And, lastly here, do please drop your comments below.  We'd love to hear your thoughts and we enjoy having a chat.""

EXCERPT #3:

""Are you a fan of popular singer, Stevie Wonder?  Well, although blind from *birth,* Stevie had mastered harmonica, piano, and drums by the age of only *8.*  Another sure sign of being a *child genius* is acquiring behaviours and skills *well* before the norm.

By *1,* many babies will babble and roll over unassisted.  Between *1 and 3,* toddlers can feed themselves without much mess.  Preschoolers, *up to 6,* will skip, ride a bicycle, and recognize *written words.*  Between *6 and 8,* children are able to follow simple directions.  Adolescents, between *12 and 18,* will understand abstract concepts. 

Is your child breaking the milestones early on?  After watching our video, be sure to check the description below.  You'll find an *extensive list* of developmental milestones.""

EXCERPT #4:

""15 year-old Tenith Adithyaa from India *cares deeply* about our planet.  And has won *15 awards* for his inventions.  ""I do not want to live with *problems,""* he says, ""I want to *solve them.""*  So *committed* is young Tenith that he was recently *hospitalized* after breathing *dangerous fumes* during an experiment in his *lab.*  From a hospital bed, he told his parents: ""*Science* needs sacrifice.""

One such remarkable invention hopes to reduce plastic waste.  Tenith *says,* ""We use many plastic plates and create a lot of waste, so I came up with an idea to make cups and plates with *banana leaves.""*  He goes on to say, ""Normally banana leaves dry up in three days because the cell wall is soft. The process that I use hardens the cell walls, preventing the leaves from drying for about a year.""  Will his invention help us?  It may well do, yes.  The Ministry of Environment and Forests, GOI, has approved his invention for use.

Is your little one interested in world events?  If you have an interest in world events *yourself,* you may notice that your little genius *also* has an interest.  One mark of a young genius is often a high level of general awareness.  If they see you watching news on TV, listening on the radio, or reading news items on your *Kindle,* it may not be long before they understand the *importance* of world events and develop a *keen interest.*""

EXCERPT #5:

""But don't go just yet.  In our next video, we'll be showing you the top 10 ways to help your child *become* a genius.  Be sure to tap the subscribe button so you don't miss it.  Thanks for watching!""

You could swim in the ocean, enjoy an ice cream or a hot dog, or brave the death-defying mechanical rides of the island‚Äôs three giant amusement parks. If you were feeling more adventurous, you could take in such spectacles as a Boer War battle reenactment starring a thousand soldiers, a burning building being extinguished by firefighters, reenactments of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the 1889 Jonestown Flood, or sideshow attractions like Lilliputia,  a village inhabited entirely by little people. But amid this ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù carnival atmosphere, one attraction would have seemed rather out of place. For a 25-cent admission fee, you could enter a sterile room attended by white-gowned nurses, in which dozens of tiny premature babies, weighing only a pound or two, lay swaddled inside glass-doored incubators. This strange exhibit was among the most popular on the island, drawing thousands of visitors every day to witness this miracle of modern medicine. But this was not some crass parody or even an advertisement for New York City hospitals; incredibly, for nearly half the Twentieth Century the Incubator Exhibit at Coney Island was among the only dedicated neonatal care facilities in the United States, taking in thousands of desperate cases that no other hospital could care for. This strange combination of hospital ward and carnival sideshow was the life‚Äôs work of a mysterious German immigrant named Dr. Martin Couney, who for nearly fifty years defied the Medical Establishment and helped give thousands of premature infants a fighting chance at life.",2d,hd,False,2020-12-17 03:41:28+00:00,,Education,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwqZojF6o64/hqdefault.jpg,,,,3-5,66,0.0,0,1,0,0,0

Released in 1985 on a relatively shoe-string budget of around $6.5 million, The Terminator is a bona fide cinema classic, but few are aware of how close this Sci-Fi cornerstone came to never being made . Today we‚Äôll be covering this and many other interesting Terminator Facts.

1) To begin with, according to James Cameron, the idea for the Terminator came to him in a nightmare while he was directing the little known budget horror movie Piranha II: The Spawning. In the nightmare, Cameron claims he was chased by a mechanical skeleton, the image of which became the basis for the T-800 and the plot.

2) Speaking of the plot, it‚Äôs worth noting that it bears some resemblance to an episode of Outer Limits written by acclaimed Sci-Fi writer, Harlan Ellison called Soldier. The episode revolves around a soldier who is sent back in time. Ellison claimed the movie had unfairly lifted from this story, which itself was based on a short story he wrote called ‚ÄúSoldier from tomorrow‚Äù, without proper credit. In the end, in exchange for an undisclosed sum and accreditation on later versions of the film, the problem went away for the studio. How much money changed hands isn‚Äôt known as a gag order was placed on the case. To this day, Cameron is still reportedly bitter about the settlement and had attempted to get the studio not to...

My curls have quite a bit of shrinkage; so routine is VERY DETAILED to show you guys how I stretch out my natural hair at home--while also minimizing tangles, breakage/ split-ends + single strand knots. With my stretch and diffuse method, my curls not only LOOK long, but are able to grow long too (because it helps to retain more length)! And, the way I diffuse gives me a shape that makes me look like I have short layers and like I have a cute curly cut/ DevaCut (but without cutting your hair or leaving home)! I hope you guys enjoy; Comment ""üí®"" if you see this!!

I wanted to relax a bit with a masked subject, because masks and costumes are much easier to draw than pure faces. So I chose to make a close-up of the Iron Man mask but I didn't find satisfactory references, and above all dynamic. Here I chose this one, rather static (I hate static photos) but which featured light effects on the mask that I really liked. Clos√¨ I had fun accentuating the reflections and some lights to avoid that toy and plastic effect with which Iron Man is almost always depicted. I hope I have succeeded and that you can appreciate it. Thanks everyone, see you next time !!

Static Brain 3.0

Step out of your comfort zone and make me some pancakes
Diners are closed, its lockdown again
Motherfucker Virus is on the throne
President Covid, welcome you all
Fuck my virgin nose, never seen a needle so long
I moan like a sex worker, arouse them all
Immune to neglect, compassion and freedom
USA flag, bright stars, Office Depot
Country of trademarks, chains and desires, 
Rich people, mansions, Malibu and fires.
Lock me again, I‚Äôll turn into a vampire.
She ain‚Äôt your toy, she‚Äôs got two degrees
Teaching you languages, tonque twisted shit.
Rasputin‚Äôs daughter, no poison can kill her.
Biggest dick in town, make a mold of it
Gen Z will appreciate it.
Her pussy is golden, her tits are diamonds
Her lips are turquoise, her eyes are rubies,
Her tongue is a twister, best blow in town,
Ballon fetish, feet fetish, what‚Äôs fetish?
Ask her, she knows, philos and logos.
Static brain, electricity off.
It‚Äôs lockdown again, lets party for the best 
California dreaming come to a test.
Momma gave me life not to be plastic,
Momma gave me life just to be fantastic.
Hollywood lights aren‚Äôt real at all.
Ghosts and witches are governors of all.
Tasting fresh blood, sweet like Halloween candy
Give me more props, I‚Äôll make you a movie star.
Bleached blonde, white teeth, black lashes,
Red lipstick, Factory of dolls..
She is a Terminator, not Marilyn, mistaken.
Can we reboot her?
No she is taken.

Factory of Dolls

Coffee cold, locked in the white room
Momma looking for me, call, don‚Äôt fall.
They measured my waist, skinny, only bones
Ask Papa Putin, he is the Boss.
Life is a trip, Seroquel helps
Dreams are lucid, only I understand .
Voices are getting louder, tell them to stop.
Cops are getting wilder, tell them to drop.
I ain‚Äôt your Barbie Doll, I am a human.
Straight jackets are in with Blasberg approval
Who am I to speak? Russians aren‚Äôt trustworthy.
Born in Abramovo, villages, potato fields. 
Farmer at heart, whore in my dreams
You want me to suck it? Lollipops are disgusting.
Only sugar free, dairy free, gluten free
Step out of your comfort zone and stand on your knees.
Reading the Bible like its MacDonal‚Äôs menu
Psalm 34, Oh David when he changed his behavior
Let him out of prison, its not just his fault
Whores in nun‚Äôs clothes.
Fall asleep like a Princess wake up like a whore
Momma told me to listen to men after all.Raised on goat milk, bunnies and chickens
Mother Russia‚Äôs best breads, so sweet, so yummy
Big tits, flat tummy, what else do you need?
Her teeth. They aren‚Äôt straight. Knock them down, put fakes.
Strong muscles, long legs, appetizing.
Can I eat her alive? Wait ill midnight.
Cinderella desserts, condensed milk and cookies
Lets hide her, she‚Äôs got too many lookies.
So rare, so raw, so fragile, so bro‚Ä¶
When is the feast? I told you to be patient
She‚Äôs got pills in her blood. No need to rush her.
Magnetic fields, 2:22, Mars, no zip code.
Turn left on Uranus, then right on Venus, continue to Earth around the penis,
What nonsense is that? GPS motherfucker
Didn‚Äôt you know Trump is a sucker?
Kamala will save us. We rotten. We stink.
Parasites souls, machine guns extinct.
We only want the best for you dear

I have gotten so much snow recently, it is hard to wander far from my cottage! So I decided to stay close to home and enjoy the little blizzard. I thought I'd do something a little different since it's such a festive time, and share a story inspired by the folklore of this season. Much love and light to all

‚Äî

‚ÄúAre you really happy with the life you live?‚Äù Speaker Sabrina Lira became fascinated by this question after learning about Nietzsche‚Äôs theory of eternal return in which Nietzsche poses the idea of living the exact same life, with the exact same relationships, emotions, and decisions over and over again. Would you choose the life you are living right now? In this eye-opening Talk, Sabrina debunks the myth that happiness is easy, and instead contends that ‚Äúthere is no such thing as an easy way to get happiness. Whatever it is the path you choose to take, you have to choose the one that is worth your sorrow, of your blood, sweat and tears. This is‚Ä¶why I believe humanity is so beautiful.‚Äù

A sky deity falling from the sky sounds bad, right? Not if it‚Äôs the Kasogonag√°! From the mythology of the Toba peoples of South America, this god of lightning, thunder, and rain appears as a small, hairy anteater-like creature and needs a bit of human intervention to return to the skies. Not your typical scary Monstrum episode, this one even features guest illustrator Ellen Surrey. 

With a long history of helping the indigenous people of South America, this cute, benevolent ‚Äòmonster‚Äô is what we all need to end 2020 with‚Äîa little hope and a smile. #kasogonaga #folklore #cute #MonstrumPBS
 
Written and Hosted by: Dr. Emily Zarka
Director: David Schulte
Executive Producer: Amanda Fox
Producer: Stephanie Noone
Illustrator: Ellen Surrey
Editor: Derek Borsheim
Produced by Spotzen for PBS Digital Studios. 

The world is full of monsters, myths, and legends and Monstrum isn‚Äôt afraid to take a closer look. The show, hosted by Emily Zarka, Ph.D., takes us on a journey to discover a new monster in each new episode. Monstrum looks at humans' unique drive to create and shape monster mythology through oral storytelling, literature, and film and digs deep into the history of those mythologies.

At the moment a star dies, astronomer Emily Levesque can see how time, space, and the universe all work. Emily Levesque studies the moment of mystery when a star dies ‚Äî the millisecond when its bright light explodes into a supernova or collapses into a black hole. By peeking through high-powered telescopes and analyzing reams of data, Emily can go back in time to discover what happened in the universe millions of years ago. In her world, the night sky only gets more beautiful when you understand how it lives and dies.

Toussaint Morrison talks with Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic about why we elect leaders that display over confidence and how this doesn't always correlate to competence. Does this issue come from the types of personalities of those that choose to run for office, or do we reward these characteristics with the way we vote? What would happen if we selected our leaders randomly, like we select our jurors for jury duty?

Even though there is legitimately nothing worth hearing here.
But with the exception of one or two slower drivers, I got to spend the majority of my session chasing people who were just barely keeping ahead by virtue of horsepower. That thrill is something few people will understand, much less get to experience. 

This event was the Jersey Shore Region PCA's annual Thunder in the Pines DE, back in 2017 at the New Jersey Motorsports Park. I was driving a 2014 Subaru Forester XT, no tune or powertrain modifications. Only changes are Michelin A/S Sport 3+ tires and Hawk HPS brake pads, which I was still babying because I was on stock brake fluid and lines.

Robert Downey Jr has appeared as Tony Stark in nine movies in Marvel‚Äôs Cinematic Universe, wearing over thirty different pairs of glasses. In Spider-Man: Far From Home his glasses became an extension of Tony Stark and a character of their own. So how did a pair of sunglasses become the star of a billion-dollar movie?

Today, we take you inside a day in the life of Theo & Harris!! 

First up, we have a shoot with Dan, a wonderful pianist whose talents will be showcased in an upcoming collaboration video with Jaquet Droz, a company that doesn't quite get the love it deserves if you ask us. Next up, a bit less thrilling, we're shooting some photos of some watches to list on the site. We have some incredible watches in this batch from everyone from Rolex to Universal Geneve to Cartier, taking a bunch of photos in advance since Michael is going home to Cape Cod for a little bit for the holidays. 

The next day, we get to do some recordings for a video with London, as well as tease the return of a fan favorite series on the channel (it's Liquor Run; Liquor Run is coming back) and the sponsor of that returning series. And of course, since we do actually sell watches here, Christian walks us through the sale of a beautiful 1016 Explorer to a client in Chicago.",2d,hd,False,2020-12-22 13:00:03+00:00,"['rolex', 'explorer', '1016', 'cartier', 'omega']",Education,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4cL9ufcZOP0/hqdefault.jpg,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],,12-14,74,1.0,0,1,0,0,0

6id0G9c9cDY,Is Forex a Scam? I Tried Trading It!,14616,41800,0.3496650717703349,975.0,25.0,279.0,839,"In this video, I attempt to trade Forex for two weeks with absolutely zero experience to see if it's something the average person should try out to secure some bags. 

The problem with Forex trading is it has attracted vast amounts of spammers ‚Äì or just slick salesmen pitching an undeniably amazing, yet attainable lifestyle if you join their training/VIP group/mastermind/course/whatever! 

I have never traded Forex before this experiment and had no idea how it even worked until I decided to dive in. Of course, I don't expect a few days of studying Forex basics and strategies to turn me into a profitable trader, but when so many gurus are advertising their services to the masses, I wanted to put some money on the line to try things out for myself. 

The #1 takeaway you should get from this video is please, don't spend money chasing a Forex lifestyle or promises of massive profit. Forex is comprised of incredibly efficient markets, making it hard for the average retail trader to turn a consistent profit.

Build info: The build is a modernised interpretation of the original sundial-calendar artefact currently located in the London Science Museum https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ . The original artefact is currently regarded as the second oldest geared mechanism on the historical record (after the Antikythera Mechanism), and is loosely dated to around 500AD. 

As the name suggests, it's a combination portable sundial and lunar calendar mechanism. In addition to being a portable sundial, it computes the current age and phase of the moon, the position of the sun and moon in the zodiac, as well as the current date. I've extended the original design to include a Lunar Node display, according to the research of the engineering historian Michael Wright. This transforms the device from a simple calendar into a very effective eclipse prediction machine. It also makes it a great tool to help visualise the celestial mechanics behind an eclipse.

What a year it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶

Unexpected, and a bit of a roller coaster, to say the least.

Yes, like almost everything in our lives, the tango world has been crucially impacted by the global pandemic‚Ä¶

But during those times of uncertainty, we saw something magical happen: 

The community of dancers we love, the one who believes in connection, musicality and artistry above all, has joined arms this years‚Ä¶

Us, tango dancers, have stayed connected, albeit in a different way. 

We‚Äôve seen your incredible passion to keep learning and keep the tango flame alive, and wow‚Ä¶ have we been impressed with how you‚Äôve showed up for tango this year üéÑ

We wanted to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support, and for the tango spirit you have shared with us this year.

Click on the video to watch our Christmas message to you, and to all tango dancers from all over the world. 



We‚Äôre now off into rest-mode for a week. Focusing on our Vals & Milonga Made Easy Online Course students, then finding the time to reconnect with our families and with ourselves for a bit‚Ä¶ 

And, we can‚Äôt wait to start 2021 with you with a bang! 

From Youtube videos to the Tango Confidence Online Course 2021, to live sessions, to webinars‚Ä¶ We have plenty in store for you starting January 4th ! 

We wish you a beautiful holiday season.

Bio: Hello World! My name is Mark Richardson. I once detonated a piece of chemistry equipment while demonstrating to two undergraduate researchers how safe it is to use. I know how to make methamphetamine and other illicit materials ‚Äì I‚Äôll walk you through the process in exchange for a beer and a cigarette. I taught undergraduate chemistry in the United States in 2017-2018 and was once held by ICE at the USA-Canadian border because I forgot to bring my employment papers with me while visiting an aquarium in Vancouver (itwasworthit.jpg). I am frequently accused of having a foreign accent, no matter where I am or how long I have lived there. I tell most people I am a scientist, or an organic synthetic chemist, depending on how likely it is they know what the second one is. Although, if I have previously applied for a job with you, it is possible I may have claimed to be something else entirely. I want to talk to all of you about the end of the world because I find it interesting and I want you to find it interesting too.

SID display with issues is between MY1998 and MY2003. ( not only between MY2002 and MY2003 that I say in the video )

Didn't even need my metal detector to find some great WW2 treasures but when I did bring the metal detector out, it brought good fortune!
I just love the history these finds represent. Good or bad, it's important to bring unearth these finds before they fade away for ever. Reicharbeidsdienst relics, Waffen SS dog tags and just lots of fun, that's the base for this video. Hope you enjoy it!

There‚Äôs a little history, and an estimate of the age of my new (old) workshop vice thrown in for good measure.

I bought the vice from a garage sale down the road for 60 English pounds. Compared to what ¬£60 will get you new, I think it was a bargain. 

Although it was likely salvageable, I make a new replacement handle from scratch, rather than spending time trying to clean up the old one. Possibly not to everyone‚Äôs taste, but this was never meant to be a faithful restoration of a historically significant tool. It‚Äôs a refurbishment of a common or garden bench vice that I‚Äôll be using for anything and everything in my workshop from now on.

The paints I use in the video come from www.paragonpaints.co.uk/ - a company I have no affiliation with.

As an Englishman, I spell vice with a C. And I occasionally spell clamp with an R. 

But not always. 

I hope everyone can get on with that.

As with my other films, this is not intended to be a how to. I'm not suggesting my method is the proper, best or only approach. It's just a record of what I did.

EPISODE 88.
It‚Äôs holiday season, so happy Christmas, Solstice, Hanukkah, Las Posadas, or whatever!
As Saint Nicholas screams overhead in a pandemic-proof jet-powered sleigh, the Tally Ho crew are are merrily cutting planks and pounding rivets. In this episode we get to know the voluntary crew a bit better as we learn new things about Clench Rings, Butt Blocks, and Bucking Irons (it may sounds dirty, but I promise these are legit boatbuilding terms). On Christmas day we have 31 planks on the boat!

I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas! Here are some verses telling us what Christmas is all about, and why we celebrate it! 
Isaiah 9:6 (ESV) For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder,  and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
John 3:15 (ESV) that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
2 Corinthians 9:15 (NCV) Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful for words.

join me, once again, on my jolly rant about the questions that people asked regarding my second renovation video.  do you enjoy explanations?  slightly thought out logic? pedantry?  then you're in the right place.  

in this video, i'll be talking about insulation, the archaic use of the word ""isolate"", and pretending that i memorized my bullet points.  if you enjoyed my last follow-up video where i combated the stinky comments with stinky comments of my own then ...  hooray.  why do i take the time to make these videos?  because i'm a retired librarian with a grumpy attitude and nothing but time üñ§

Ich habe mich mit Jacky √ºber die Hochs und Tiefs auf ihrer GNTM-Reise, √ºber Supporter und Hater, √ºber ihren ‚ÄûMitbewohner‚Äú Kurt Krug und viele weitere Dinge unterhalten. Auf Instagram hat Jacky selbst gesagt: ""Ich rede so intim wie nie. Es war f√ºr mich ein gro√üer Schritt, aber ich f√ºhle mich wohl damit.""

zTyZgOkWs4o,Antique Hand Cranked Hammer Drill - Restoration,8959508,2010000,4.457466666666667,141149.0,5878.0,7566.0,1595,"It was in spring this year when I picked up this beaten up antique hand cranked hammer drill. My friend has found it on the steel waste together with the german ‚ÄûWeltrekord‚Äú ratchet screwdriver. The condition of the drill was super bad. It was very corroded, had a lot of missing screws, the handle was in very bad condition and the crank was bent so much you couldn't even make a full turn. That's all said, it was the perfect item for a new restoration video.
At first I thought this should be a quick and easy project, but one problem after the other became visible and it turned out to be a real challenge. There was the big dent in the left side of the case. Usually you can't bend casted parts, but with a bit of heat and careful pressure on the arbor press I was able to remove it a bit. It also worked to get rid of the warping with some heat. For the finish of the housing I wanted to have an antique cast aluminium look. I thought it would look very cool if I could tumbler these parts after sandblasting. I ended up building a huge rotary tumbler from scratch and it worked very well (video link below).
Another big issue was the tool holder and the drill bit, as they were both completly rusted. Big thanks to @Hand Tool Rescue  at this point for helping me out with the dimensions on these two parts by disassembling and measuring his own hammer drill. After a bit of search on eBay I found a set of original Rawlplug drill bits. After they arrived I was able to measure the shaft and the taper of the drill to then turn a new tool holder. It all worked out very well and yes, the drill only holds with the taper ;-)
Before I even started this project I just had one question in mind ‚ÄûHow am I going to replace the messed up handle cover?‚Äú. My first idea was to wrap it in nice black leather like steering wheels are made. That would definitely work, but that's something I've never done before so I was quite sceptical. Then the idea of a heat shrink tube came up. That would be a very easy solution, but heat shrink tubes don't have any structuires to it and it wouldn't quite fit the the rest of the tool. Thanks to the research of my Patreons and channel members, they have found very special heat shrink tubes that have a structure in it. I really liked it as it almost looked exactly the same like the original handle.
After all it was a very intense and time consuming project. I've done so many hours of research on this one and I had to learn new skills. I'm very happy how it turned out.

I hope you like my work and the video.

She was a treasured member of our community, a true maker at heart, and ever ready with words of praise or encouragement. May her support, kindness and enthusiasm be carried forward by all of us to keep her spirit alive.

To remind myself of her and process her loss, I printed a shirt with her logo on it. I only needed a couple of prints, so instead of using photo emulsion and exposing the screen, I used a vinyl cutter to make a mask. It only lastsfor a few prints, but it's quick and easy to do.

If you're not familiar with Sharon's work, go look at her amazing videos here:

This way I can feel comfortable, and feminine at the same time.  I think it's important to feel your best, even when you're only at home.

What is #ASMR? ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It's defined as a ""calming, pleasurable feeling often accompanied by a tingling sensation."" If you've ever zoned out listening to a sound or watching a video and experienced a tingly sensation, then you've experienced ASMR! ASMR videos help people get to sleep. They can also help with anxiety and anxiousness (speaking from personal experience). So, sit back, relax and enjoy these tingle inducing sounds!",2d,hd,False,2020-12-24 19:00:00+00:00,"['ASMR', 'whispered ramble', 'Self help']",Entertainment,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0btJ1Mc6dM4/hqdefault.jpg,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment'],,18-20,52,1.0,0,1,1,0,0

Each environment features a unique creature with a look and lore inspired by the environment they inhabit. The series of films has the scope and beauty of a nature series (Planet Earth, Blue Planet) with the thrills and terror of the best horror films. We‚Äôre using UNREAL ENGINE to bring this series of films to life utilizing it‚Äôs capabilities for our full-film pre-visualization, creature design, world building, Virtual Production and final VFX. 
Our mission is to give audiences a one of a kind movie going experience that elevates the horror genre to its greatest cinematic heights through the creation of a series of immersive Survival-horror films.
We are very excited to share with you our official trailer, created entirely in Unreal.
From Aaron Sims:
‚ÄúDIVE‚Äù is the first example of how we at ASC are using UNREAL engine as the backbone of our process for Virtual Art Direction, Production, and VFX. ASC‚Äôs UNREAL pipeline will be indispensable in helping filmmakers realize their visions in real-time.
I have been in the film industry for decades and have seen numerous changes in VFX during that time, and UNREAL is the first tool that I have used as an artist, VFX professional, and filmmaker that really has no limits as to what can be achieved - in half the time and for half the cost.

After Chad Wild Clay made ""DO NOT TOUCH ELECTRIC FENCE! I Tested Prank Hacks on My Best Friend To Protect Spy Ninjas Safe House"", Vy Qwaint created ""HACKERS STOLE OUR HOUSE! Spy Ninjas Surprised Project Zorgo with a Battle Royale!"", and Daniel Gizmo uploaded ""Can You Survive the Chaos Simulator? Spy Ninjas vs Moving Uhaul Truck Challenge!"", the hackers finally found out our safe house location. Even though Burn Face got arrested by the FBI police, the other hackers at the headquarters must have discovered the location. Now that our house is revealed, the hackers have taken over. They kicked us out. Now we are trapped and homeless. We had to stay in a tent and go camping for a 24 hour overnight challenge. We did manage to get our hacker-proof DeLorean back but that is it! They threw away our gold play buttons! Our old ninja friend Perlita showed up and revealed her secret underground tunnel that leads to the bottom of our house! The hatch can be our way back inside the safe house! There will definitely be a battle royale going on once we get in. Good thing we have a lot of Spy Ninja training and fruit chopping skills. These hackers are going to get defeated! There is no escape for them! Thank you for watching my funny entertainment comedy adventure vlog videos in 2020!

I spent less than $10 and have since seen bird feeders this size for sale at stores for $80 or more!  And they are not nearly as nice!

Mitered corners on the base, a little angled detail on the side pieces, and acrylic panels to hold the seed and let you see when the feeder needs to be refilled are design highlights.  I made mine out of cedar because it is naturally bug and decay resistant and it weathers to a nice grayish brown color over time, but you can make this bird feeder out of any kind of material... just don't use ""treated"" lumber... it's not good for the birds.

In part one we lay the groundwork by building the base and gluing up the panels for the sides.  In part two, we build the roof, cut the acrylic panels, and make the hanging system.  This design lends itself well to making multiple copies, so build 2, or 3, or more.  This bird feeder will be a joy in your garden and will make a great gift for every bird-lover on your list.

About Places 2 Go Travel  P2GT 
=====================================================
On my travels I'm joined by my good lady (most of the time), my Dad (some of the time) our wider family occassionally and my dog when not travelling overseas. 

What's This Channel About: It started as a travel diary, as a way to share our experiences with our friends and family. A wider audience took an interest in my videos and things just grew from there. I'm trilled at the idea that people on Youtube may get something out of my videos and I love to connect with people who are like minded and enjoy travel as much as we do. 

Why We Love To Travel: As a young adult I was always too busy working to take vacations. My mindset was fixed on building a successful business and this was always justified by telling myself that I'd travel once I'd made my fortunes. By the time I was 30 years old I'd only been on two overseas vacations and did not think I was missing out. Roll forward to 2015,  my good lady  finally convinced me to book a stay at an all inclusive resort in Fuerteventura. It was an amazing experience and I was instantly bitten by the travel bug and now want to see loads of different places and travel as much as we can. 

How frequently Do you Travel : As frequently as possible, currently around seven times per year. We have committments at home meaning we need to fit our travel plans in around everyday life.  

Why Are We Not On Camera: These videos are about the places, adventures, experiences and destinations. The videos are not about me / us - I'm not a TV presenter and I have absolutely not desire to be in front of the camera. Whilst not adverse to being on camera it's just not what our videos are about at the moment. 

What's in our kitbag: Canon SX540, Canon SX510, various GoPro cameras including the Hero 3 Hero 4 Black and the Hero 5 Black plus a Nextbase Dashcam and Samsung and Apple cameraphones. 

Our Favorite Places 2 Go Travel: Canary Islands, especially Lanzarote & Fuerteventura are big favourites with us because of the near year round sun and relaxing vibes.

wpOjbyPVl9s,(121) Experiment: Removing superglue from locks,996,1720,0.5790697674418605,41.0,2.0,25.0,802,"About a month ago (May 23rd?) Lockpicking Patrolman did a livestream where he demonstrated the old but unfortunately common vandalism tactic of applying superglue to a lock to disable it (this was distressingly common as part of various scams and criminal schemes in New York City in the bad old days, and still happens occasionally though less commonly as a prelude to far worse crimes now). Anyway, I was inspired by LPP's experiment and some suggestions from the commenters (thank you #LockForce folks) to try an experiment that was both slightly more realistic and would pit some competing theories against each other.

SInce we are still largely in lockdown mode here at Nite0wl Labs I ordered several identical deadbolts, a package of single use KrazyGlue styrettes, and some 'dental syringes' (already having a ready supply of suitable solvents and lock mounts on hand). The experimental setup was simple, take two deadbolts and inject as close to 1/2 of a single styrette of superglue into the keyway of each as possible, then leave the glue to cure for roughly 6 hours (to make sure it is well hardened as it usually is when it is confronted by a locksmith). Unfortunately I decided to apply the glue while the deadbolts were sitting on the packaging rather than after I had installed them on the test mount which resulted in some performance issues but did not seriously affect the validity of the tests).

And yes, I realize this method is not exactly easy to carry around in your tool bag on the off chance you get a lockout call like this, but it is useful information and might help someone avoid entirely destroying a lock unnecessarily.",2d,hd,False,2020-07-03 23:53:53+00:00,,Education,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wpOjbyPVl9s/hqdefault.jpg,dict_keys(['en']),['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],en,21-23,47,1.0,0,1,0,0,0

Optimizing your key to your lock can have significant results in increasing your lock‚Äôs security and today we are going to explore the topic of key bitting. Key bitting is referring to the ‚Äúups and downs‚Äù or the ‚Äúteeth‚Äù of your key. We will go over how you can find the correct balance of variation to help optimize your lock. Having too much or too little can affect your locks in different ways. 

If you have a lock with a key which has ‚Äúgood bitting‚Äù it will be able to help thwart low-level attacks and I will provide you with a visual representation as to why. This is an interesting topic and I hope it is helpful üòä

From fire starting to shelter, this video provides a unique combination of basic tips and advanced tricks, delivered in expert Ovens fashion.

Greg is a self-taught survivalist from Canal Flats, British Colombia, who, since he was a boy, has read nearly every book on the topic. When he is not out in the wilderness, he is a professional dry-waller. He started his first bow drill fire when he was thirteen and spent the next forty years learning bushcraft and studying plants and edibles. He has even developed some of his own survival techniques and is a skilled hunter with both a bow and a slingshot.

This fashionable, yet practical carryall was designed specifically for automotive locksmiths. Sorry res/comm guys! The upper compartment holds up to twenty keys or remotes and can serve as a functional display case for Xhorse and KeyDIY universal remotes. Flip it open and let your customer choose their key, or use that space to line up all the smart keys and remotes you have scheduled to program that day. You can even use it to store all your high-dollar smart keys, so you can easily bring them in the house with you when your day is done. The bottom-most compartment is completely modular and was intended for machine storage, but you can stuff it with whatever you best see fit.

The bag also features an insulated Velcro pouch, where you can store your chargers, cables, blades, or chips. It will also provide a layer of protection for your machines when the bag is zipped close. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, there‚Äôs even an extra storage pouch on the backside of the bag, which is large enough to store almost anything your heart desires.

This is the first bag of its kind, meant to provide protection and storage for the various programming tablets, cloners, and remote generators that have made their way into your automotive locksmithing arsenal. Protect your investments, stay organized, and give your customers a unique experience that is typically only achieved in a brick-and-mortar environment.",2d,hd,False,2020-10-05 05:38:36+00:00,,Autos & Vehicles,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wWnsrmTFGcw/hqdefault.jpg,,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)'],,3-5,48,0.0,0,0,0,0,0

For some time I had a surfacing bit with carbide inserts and an 8mm shaft, which is a common standard size for router bits in the EU. I quite like it and the manufacturer of it is Fraiser. So I had a look at their website and found some other bits for the CNC router that seemed to be very promising. And they also have an affiliate program. So I contacted them and asked for a few router bits. And in exchange for this video they sent them to me. So yes, this was a sponsored video. Instead of a project I first wanted to push the bits and my CNC machine to the limit. Also, I wanted to have cutting data that were made on my machine. For the future, that means, I never have to guess what cut settings I need to use. I can just look them up. And that's what I did in t his video.
Thanks again to Fraiser for supporting this video and making the giveaway possible.

Fun never goes extinct with Cave Club! Travel back to dyno-time and craft together with Tella and Rockelle. They continue preparations for Tyra's birthday, and these are the crafts they are sharing with us!

The first craft is a group of magic crystals made of non-toxic modeling clay. Take three different colors of clay (white, purple, and pink), and mix them. Press them down into a square block and, using a plastic safety tool cut into long rectangular prisms and then give them a crystal-like form. For the finishing touches, use white paint on the rocks' edges to make them look like real ones!

And of course, there is no Birthday party without a cake! Take some non-toxic modeling clay, flatten it out on a surface using a rolling pin, and then give it shape with a plastic, round, cookie-cutter. Repeat the same process with smaller pieces on top. For extra color, decorate the cake with modeling clay around the cake base and then use some more clay on top for the cake glaze. Use a paper straw as the central candle, and voila. Remember that this cake is only for dynos - not people! :)

And of course, enjoy more crafts for Polly Pocket and Barbie!

I've had some really bad luck with this project because the handle broke during the last bits of turning. I did not include this in the video because the video would be too long then.  You can see the broken handle in my Youtube stories from a couple of days ago.

I was planning to smash some stuff with the Mace, but i  think the handle is to fragile for that. I'm a bit worried it will snap in to 2 pieces. 

The filament I used for the 3D print was Polycast from Polymaker. It burns out VERY clean at rather low temperatures compared to ABS or PLA. http://eu.polymaker.com/product/polycast/

so after i made a fall guys clone in the last video, i was destroyed by comments about Among us, so here we go, Im making among us. Took me like 1-2 weeks, was actually much more work than i thought it would be.
this version is 3d, so it's quite the different experience, but it's a lot of fun. Unfortuantely, I can't give out the download, at least not yet. If anything changes, you will be able to find the download here. cheers

A casa real de Habsburgo era feita de uma nobreza que que reinava sob ducados e reinos. Eles n√£o gostavam de se misturar com as outras fam√≠lias nobres, existia um medo de perder o pedigree do seu sangue. Por isso casamentos consangu√≠neos entre primos de primeiro grau, primos de segundo grau e entre tios e sobrinhas acabavam acontecendo em poucas gera√ß√µes. Isso acabou criando problemas gen√©ticos como a famosa mand√≠bula de Habsburgo e alguns s√©rios problemas de sa√∫de. Essas condi√ß√µes gen√©ticas fizeram com que aos poucos que esse ramo da dinastia desaparecesse at√© chegar ao √∫ltimo herdeiro de sua linhagem, Carlos II. Sua √°rvore geneal√≥gica, seu heredograma, era complexo. Seu pai era tio de sua m√£e e seus av√≥s maternos eram primos de primeiro grau e os paternos de segundo grau. O seu DNA e seus genes condenaram Carlos a uma vida dif√≠cil, uma mente e um corpo fr√°gil no topo do seu castelo.

Those two planets align about every twenty years, but once or twice a millennium they align so closely that they appear as one incredibly bright temporary object that's highly visible to the unaided human eye. This happened in December 2020, March of 1226, and in May of 7 BC. In this video we'll look at the historical and astronomical evidence as we think through four different possibilities for what the Christmas Star might have been.

List of supernovae from the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams
http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/lists/Supernovae.html

Novae are relatively small explosions in double star systems. They come about when a white dwarf‚Äôs intense gravity tugs material away from a companion star. Gas piles up around the white dwarf and eventually becomes dense enough to ignite in a burst of nuclear fusion.
Most supernovas, meanwhile, mark the deaths of massive stars and the formation of neutron stars. They are triggered when a shockwave tears through the outer layers of a dying star, igniting a firestorm of nuclear fusion. 
https://www.howitworksdaily.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-nova-supernova-and-hypernova/

As a result of their long orbits, Jupiter and Saturn meet in the sky only once every 20 years. In this period of time, Saturn completes two-thirds of its 30-year orbit (since 20 is two-thirds of 30). In the same period, Jupiter completes one 12-year orbit, plus, in the remaining 8 years, two-thirds of its next orbit (since 8 is two-thirds of 12). In other words, 20 years is the time it takes Jupiter to catch up and pass Saturn again as they circle the Sun.
The above figures are round numbers. More precise figures are 11.86 years for Jupiter's orbital period, 29.46 years for Saturn's orbital period, and 19.86 years for the average frequency of a great conjunction
